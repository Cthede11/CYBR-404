I learned a few things from Megan's presentation. During the presentation
I wrote a few notes on how all of the questions she was having us use as
examples seemed to be able to fit into a few categories: questions that 
pertained to the employees personal past, questions that were about the 
employee and their time at the company, and questions that would open 
to conversation to how things will change in the future. When I talked 
with Megan after class she explained that, while they all fell under 
these categories, there is no perfect format for approaching a potential 
employer. So at the basic level, I learned that you need to know about 
who you are talking to, their company, and anything else you can think 
of because at the end of the day, the conversation can go anywhere.
